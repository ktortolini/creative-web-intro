# Personal Portfolio

## _Description_

This repository is the first iteration of a personal portfolio, showcasing my work and skills. It is currently a static site with an `HTML` file and a `CSS` file. The front-end is designed with _TailwindCSS_ by [@tailwindlabs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs), providing a modern and responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This portfolio will gradually expand over time and will be deployed in the near future.
